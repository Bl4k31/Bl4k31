# About:
## Hi, I'm Blake! 👋
I am a student at SPCC

I like coding and coding-related subjects
- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  * A chat system written in bash
  * Small miscellaneous snippets of code
  * A Python calculator with a Tk-based UI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/have learnt:
  * Python
  * C/C++/C#
  * Java
  * HTML/(React)JS/CSS
  * Bash
- ⚡ Fun fact:
  * I like pentesting and security

I hope to become a full-stack developer at some point

I only work on small projects occasionally (for now).
